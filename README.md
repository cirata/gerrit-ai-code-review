# gerrit-ai-code-review
A fork of the Gerrit ai-code-review Plugin, which supports LTS versions which are no longer supported by community, or in some cases versions which weren't released at the time. 

Original plugin can be found here: [ai-code-review](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/ai-code-review)

To download the appropriate release, please visit the [GitHub releases](../../releases) page for this repository, or clone directly from the appropriate tag.

N.B Default "master" branch is only an empty placeholder.
